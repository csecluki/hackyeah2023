# Project description

Euro Power Plant Simulator aims to spread knowledge about the impact of electricity production on environmental pollution, both locally and throughout Europe as a coherent area of our existence, for the condition of which each resident is individually responsible. The interactive simulation provides the user with the opportunity to design an energy network for the whole of Europe and compare the impact of the location and types of power plants on energy demand, construction costs and pollution levels in individual regions. To better illustrate the results, the simulation presents data in visual form on a map of Europe and in numerical form, collected in tables for the selected region and the whole of Europe.



The simulation user has the ability to manipulate:

- type of power plant: nuclear, coal, hydro, wind, solar

- the number of power plants of each type in the region



The simulation shows:

- energy demand by regions and total

- meeting energy demand by regions and in total

- volume of electricity production by regions and total

- the impact of constructed power plants on environmental pollution by region and total

- cost of building a power plant network by region and total



The simulation recalculates the user's input taking into account:

- energy demand

- transfer of surplus production to neighboring regions

- degree of pollution depending on the type of power plant and its location

- construction cost depending on the type of power plant

- variable efficiency of individual types of power plants depending on the construction region (impact of environmental factors, availability of raw materials, availability of a sufficient number of qualified personnel in a given region, multiplicity of the region)

- variable power plant efficiency depending on the number of power plants built and the size of the region
